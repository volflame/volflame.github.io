If you&#x27;re stumbling upon this website and you have no idea what it is, or if you just want to learn more about my vision for this website, I have created this Artist&#x27;s Statement for your convenience! Without further ado, I&#x27;d like to introduce my final project for my COLLEGE 113: Utopia, Dystopia, and Technology:</p><p class="mb-4">My project explores the fundamental question, how can an interactive critical dystopia showcase and even disturb the oppressive rhythm of human civilization? How do our actions translate to power and change, allowing us to avoid a &quot;real-life dystopia&quot; (whatever that may be)? And whether safety and stability are worth the price of truth, autonomy, and human dreams. In my story, the &quot;last bastion&quot; of humanity lives underwater, believing that the world above was completely uninhabitable due to the man-eating titans rampaging the lands. This is heavily based off the premise of the Attack on Titan franchise, and especially nods to the ending, where after all the events of the story, there is a timelapse of human history repeating itself over and over again. In these timelapses, humans use violence for progression (represented by urban development and weapons manufacturing) until they come to a stand still, hidden between walls or cities. It forces the viewer to think existentially, confronting their own role in society, what freedoms they have, and how they contribute to the rhythm of human civilization. I don&#x27;t believe the world I built neatly fits into a critical utopia or a critical dystopia. It has elements of a utopia earlier on (safety under water) and slowly reveals itself to be a dystopia (by what means is this safety achieved). It finally becomes some semblance of a hopeful society when the protagonist finds themselves sprinting into the world above, neither utopia nor dystopia. I modeled this after the end of Princess Mononoke when nature is healing, but no one knows how much or if it will ever become its old self.</p><p class="mb-4">I also took a lot of inspiration from Eternal Hospital. In the story, we follow the main character, who must confront the fact that his mother is not his real mother, until he realizes at the end that he is not his real self. Throughout the story, I 100% humanized the main character. To me, he was undoubtedly human, on a journey to expose an exploitative health magnate that tried to create humans in an unethical way. However, realizing that the main character was a neogen all along invites an immense amount of new thoughts and feelings, at least for me. In my story, I wanted to create a similar confrontationâ€”as a parallel, to neogens, if one does not know their dreams are being stolen, or that there is a habitable world above, yet they still live a perfectly normal life, does their unbeknownst restriction of freedom justify the means by which they live comfortably?</p><p class="mb-4">I decided to use a website to answer my main question and make a case for my central argument because it fits my question perfectly. During my initial meeting with Elaine discussing potential directions for a project, one route we discussed was the &quot;gamification&quot; route, and creating something that a user can interact with to perhaps overhaul how the user interacts with the story, and reacts to it. For me, a major aspect of this website was exactly its gamified, &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; gimmick that bridges the psychic distance between the reader and the story. To choose your own story is to have agency in the actions around you. In my story, choosing (intended) complacency/adherence to the status quo is, surprise surprise, what maintains the social structure of control, allowing the human race under the water to not understand the world above, because they are given something yet they never challenge it. If you adhere to the norm, will you ever live to your fullest? I wanted to make these choices difficult, and force the reader to confront certain values they held, maybe imagining themselves in the protagonist&#x27;s shoes and wondering what decision they choose, or perhaps adhering to their own morals and understanding of the world, the status quo, and the life they live. How will their actions impact the world for other individuals? Will they continue harvesting dreams and souls for the sake of human safety, or would they rather humans keep their spiritual agency and confront the &quot;dangers&quot; above the water?</p><p class="mb-4">I had a lot of creative direction in making this project. I wrote the entire story myself, from start-to-finish, with some feedback from my peers that I took into account. I spent a few hours scrolling through Pinterest to really create a mood for my website, adding inspiration pics to set the scene of each &quot;act&quot; of my story. Given Elaine&#x27;s suggestions, I decided to add music that fit for the &quot;vibe&quot; I was imagining. I also called in my best friend, Maitreyi, an avid fantasy reader, to narrate my story in her best story-telling voice. Hopefully, the website user has fun listening to her narration of the story! In creating an interactive website, I used React conditionals and buttons to &quot;switch&quot; the version of the page based on what the user chose. I do wish I could be a little more intricate with the endings, perhaps create some less &quot;black and white&quot; decisions and create stories based off of those. However, given the scope of the project and our 5-week sprint, I believe my website achieves the soul of what I wanted it to.</p><p class="mb-4">Thank you for taking the time to read my Artist&#x27;s Statement, and I invite you stick around for a few more minutes!
